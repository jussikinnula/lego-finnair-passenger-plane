# Lego Finnair Passenger Plane

This passenger plane actually doesn't represent any airliners colours, as it's plain white. For example Finnair uses such colouring with their new brand name logo attached on top of the window row, and an "F" in the tail.

Note! The aircraft head / cabin is missing from the model, as the 3D part is not available. See the part from BrickLink catalog here: [https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=67241pb01&idColor=1](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=67241pb01&idColor=1)
